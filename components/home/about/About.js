              Hey! I&apos;m Erion, a 20yr student majoring in Business
              Administration who has a passion about technology. I have always
              been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to make our
              lives easier and more connected. I specialize in the frontend,
              primarily Javascript and React, but love building with whatever
              tools are right for the job.
